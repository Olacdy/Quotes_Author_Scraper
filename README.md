## Description

By doing this project I wanted to demonstrate my abilities to solve problems connected with data mining.

Problem. Site "Quotes to Scrape" is designed to explore different techniques and ways of scraping data from web pages. Standard practice is to scrape quotes from every page, but I decided to go further and scrape all quotes authors. To solve that task, I have been using a Python framework called Scrapy. It's a powerful tool that gives you many means to scrape data and represent it in different formats.

The designed script allows users to scrape authors and save them in one of the following formats: JSON, SQLite, MySQL, and XML.
